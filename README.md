# Simple Random Text Generator

A simple program to generate text files based on a set of words (in `words.txt`). Note that it will not generate any grammatically accurate sentence. It only shuffles and repeats the given words.

## How to Use?

With Rust installed, runs:

```
> cargo run
```

Then, you will see the output files in `/out`.
